                                This was my last years project at Hasso-Plattner-Institute. In the final year every student is
                                required to build a project in a team of 5-10 people.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Our project was based on a project that that was done the year before us.
                                These students built an app that can authenticate users solely by
                                their behaviour (e.g. the way they walk, or take their phone out of their pocket).
                                With this new way to authenticate users can access gates to restricted
                                areas (e.g. offices) just by walking to the gate (the phone stores all the information and communicates with the gate).
                                This removes the need for the employee to carry a keycard, which can be a target of theft. Click below to watch a short demo.

                            <p >
                                The goal of our project was to create an access management platform that is suited to work with this authentication method.
                                An easy to use web application which enables the facility management to set different permission
                                levels for different gates, register new employees/guests and their devices and block access for certain employees/devices if needed.

                            I’m a big fan of the board game Catan. I remember my dad buying the first edition back then and we were playing it over and over again. I’m also deeply in love with the variation “Catan: Starfarers” which is basically the same as Catan but set in space: you have to build space ships, discover foreign planets and sometimes fight against other players.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For the normal Catan and some variations it’s possible to play it online against friends or random people. But unfortunately not for the Starfarers game. Therefore I decided to work on an online multiplayer version with Unity.

            <h2>Born in Berlin and still in love with this beautiful city.</h2>
            <p>
                I was born 1994 in Berlin and was always curious to
                learn right from the start. I guess this comes mainly
                from growing up with an older brother. We spent a lot of
                time together in our youth and I was always very competitive
                and wanted to beat him at everything. I wanted to learn how
                to get better and stayed up late to learn his tricks. In some
                cases my training paid off and led me to victory. But often times
                the age difference and superior knowledge of my brother led to another outcome.
                But that didn’t held me back from trying again and again.

                This mindset helped me a lot in the world of coding. My first
                interaction with coding was solving questions on Project Euler. I cannot
                count how often I felt defeated trying to solve the challenges there. But my
                curiosity to learn helped me through it and I again stayed up late to learn
                all the tricks. If I didn’t know the answer immediately I would constantly
                think about it - even in my sleep. Right then I knew that I wanted to pursue
                a career in Software Engineering and I started to study IT-System Engineering
                at Hasso-Plattner-Institute. This further fueled my love for coding and all
                its possibilities. Since then I worked on various small software projects
                and also gained some experience working in a professional environment.

                In my free time I do several things like bouldering, playing snooker, playing guitar or cutting videos.
